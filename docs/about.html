    About Me
  </h1>
  
<p>
  I write mods as a hobby and work full time as a software developer. 
  </p>
 <br><p>
I'm relatively new to modding, having started in 2019, and to general developing, having received my first employment in 2019. Before I was an editor and analyst,
but my passion is in the very creative and challenging sphere of programming.  </p><br>
  <p>
Despite my programming skills, I actually have a Creative Writing Degree with a Computer Science Minor. I've lived most of my life overseas as a military child, in countries like Japan, Italy, and Germany. </p>

  About My Mods
  </h1>

  <p>
  Each of my Baldur's Gate characters has their own quest, goals, story, and personality. They include a gnome bard, a half-elf archer, an elf shadowdancer/mage, a dwarven cleric, and a halfling barbarian.
