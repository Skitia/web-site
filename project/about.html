      <p>I first played Baldur's Gate almost twelve years ago. Having always loved the series, I wanted to give my hand to the many great mods before me at my own works. My preference are NPC Mods, where I can develop an original character from start to finish and incorporate it into the great story of Baldur's Gate.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Favorite Characters: Aerie, Mazzy.</li>

        <li>Favorite Class: Archer, Swashbuckler, Cavalier.</li>
        
        <li> Favorite Baldur's Gate NPC Mod: Aura.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Mod Voices: Most of my Mods use sounds from NWN, except Recorder who uses sounds from Fire Emblem's Azura. </li>

           <li>Portraits: Most of my mods use images from NWN, except Recorder who uses a portrait painted by the very talented Nicole Cadet. You can see her other work  <a href = "https://www.nicolecadet.com/">here</a>   </li>
         
           <li>Requirements: All Mods require either BG:EE, BG:EE with SoD, or BG:EE(2). The old versions will not work.  </li>
          
           <li>Influence: A lot of technical influence derives from AionZ who has made excellent mods of their own. You can learn more about them <a href = "https://artisans-corner.com/">here</a>.</li>
             <li>The Branwen mod by was also an excellent tutorial, which you can find <a href = "http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php?topic=28623.0">here</a>.</li> 
        <li>Lastly, many characters were based or influenced by characters sourcing from the great NWN PW world Arelith, which you can learn about <a href = "http://www.nwnarelith.com/">here</a>.   </li>
