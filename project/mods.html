  <h2>Romance & Dialogue Expansion</h2>

  <pre class = "mod-info">Nalia At Last is a very long awaited romance for Throne of Bhaal. Continue a romance from the Nalia Romance or the De'Arnise romance, or start the romance from the ground up at the start of Throne of Bhaal.

  Note: If you have both romances installed, the mod will follow Arnel's Nalia Romance branch.

  <h2>Tweaks for Bioware SoA Romances</h2>

These tweaks increase the time limit to fifty days, allowing you to switch to other party members for a longer time before needing to rejoin.
          
  Additionally, most romance breaks caused by removing Jaheira from the party are removed entirely.

  <pre class = "mod-info">An exile from Evermeet, Vienxay bitterly walks the mostly human lands of the Sword Coast seeking revenge and purpose, while still carrying her dignity and class from the Green Isles, making her tough to love.

  In BG1, she seeks to kill the elf who framed her, a Sharran mage. If you give this hand to this elf, she in return will give her own talents to the party, shadow dancing and the weave together. And in SoD she seeks out a mentor who can help give her new power for her shadow magic abilities. 
    
  Lastly, in BG2, she must choose between the desperate desire to return home, or a competing desire for greater power.

  <h2>Quest & Dialogue Expansion</h2>
  
  <pre class = "mod-info">Wings is originally a work by Coutelier, started back in the end of 2013. The main quest content was never finished, and there was a bug or two in the original mod. The completed version of Wings fixes these bugs, and also finishes adding the main quest content and a small side-quest with Minsc.

  This mod also includes all of the original content, including several extra banters, and a few characters that breath a bit more life into Aerie's background.
