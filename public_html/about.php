      About me
    </h2>
      <p>
        I first played Baldur's Gate almost twelve years ago. Having always loved the series, I wanted to give my hand to the many great mods before me at my own works.
   As you can see, my preference are NPC Mods, where I can develop an original character from start to finish and incorporate it into the great story of Baldur's Gate.

    </p>

         <h2>
     Technical Site and Credits: </h2>

   <ul>
  <li>Mod Voices: Most of my Mods use sounds from NWN, except Recorder who uses sounds from Fire Emblem's Azura. </li>
   <br>
     <li>Portraits: Most of my mods use images from NWN, except Recorder who uses a portrait painted by the very talented Nicole Cadet. You can see her other work  <a href = "https://www.nicolecadet.com/">here</a>   </li>
   <br>
     <li>Requirements: All Mods require either BG:EE, BG:EE with SoD, or BG:EE(2). The old versions will not work.  </li>
    <br>
     <li>Influence: A lot of technical influence derives from AionZ (See their work here: ) who has made excellent mods of their own. You can learn more about them <a href = "https://artisans-corner.com/">here</a>.</li>
       <li>The Branwen mod by was also an excellent tutorial, which you can find <a href = "http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php?topic=28623.0">here</a>.</li> 
  <li>Lastly, many characters were based or influenced by characters sourcing from the great NWN PW world Arelith, which you can learn about <a href = "http://www.nwnarelith.com/">here</a>.   </li>
   <br>  </li>
        <li>Availability to Help with Other Mods: I don't mind sharing a bit of time in proofreading or quick testing. Just reach out on the Beamdog Forums or via my Contact form.</li>
